# Learning Portfolio


## Inspiration

In our academic lives, we often get well-written feedback from teachers, but we never know what to do to improve. We also sometimes have patterns in our grades and feedback based on the topic, but are not able to notice them ourselves and understand why they matter. It would be impossible for teachers to individually respond to students to show them their trends and help them improve, so we thought of the potential applications for AI in this learning portfolio concept.

## What it does

Our solution is an AI powered Learning Portfolio, which: 
- Compiles all of a studentâ€™s scores and feedback from their assignments and tells them how they have improved over time and what areas they still need to work on.
- Creates personalized and details plans on how to grow in those areas
This solution is meant to help students understand what they have been doing well and where to focus their attention on to improve. Showing them how they have already grown should also motivate them to keep going, which is often a big struggle for many students.

## What's next for EssayWay

We plan to add visuals and graphs that can better help other types of students utilize this tool and get the most out of it.
